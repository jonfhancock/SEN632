There are three packages in this repo, moderator, client, and shared.

Classes in both the client and moderator packages depend on the shared package.  
To compile either the client or the moderator, com.apps4you.shared must be in the classpath.

Included are the moderator.jar and client.jar.   
To run, open one instance of moderator, and as many instances of client as you like.
There are two warriors included (Arthur Dent.wdat and Marvin.wdat).  
If you want to have more than two warriors, you must create new ones with the New Warrior button.
wdat files for the warriors will automatically be saved in the current working directory using the warrior's name.
